## Heterogeneity of treatment effects: what and why

**Heterogeneity of treatment effects**:
* differential effect of exposure/intervention across subgroups
* .green[does not necessarily imply a causal or biological interpretation]

--

If HTE is present:
* .blue1[resources can be prioritized] to maximize benefit and reduce risks .small[[Knol and VanderWeele (2012)]]
* can determine whether intervention .green[remediates] or .red[exacerbates] health disparities .small[[Petkovic et al. (2020)]]

---

## Case study: ENSPIRE trial

**ENSPIRE**: Engaging Staff to Improve COVID-19 Vaccination Response at Long-term Care Facilities

&amp;zwj;Background:
* Rates of COVID-19 disease and death higher in long-term care than general population .small[[Chidambaram (2022)]]
* Lag in COVID-19 vaccinations among long-term care workers
* Long-term care (LTC) workers often low-wage, represent diverse social, cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds

--

&amp;zwj;Design:
* Enrolled 40 LTC centers, encompassing approximately 4000 staff members
* Recruited from 2 US states (Georgia and Washington)
* Recruited from urban (Atlanta or Seattle) and suburban/rural locations

---

## Case study: ENSPIRE trial

.blue1[Primary outcomes:]
1. LTC center COVID-19 booster rate (.blue1[cluster-level])
  * chosen due to concerns about data capture
2. LTC care staff net promoter score (.blue2[individual-level])

.green[Intervention:] booster promotion materials co-designed with LTC staff

&lt;img src="img/enspire_intervention.PNG" width="80%" height="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Case study: ENSPIRE trial

Co-design: .green[tailoring] messages to specific audiences
* In ENSPIRE, focused on .blue1[language, cultural, and ethnic affinity] groups
* Measured race and ethnicity allowing 57 total options 

--

HTE analysis natural for interventions, particularly co-designed:
* Planned analyses based on state, urban vs suburban/rural, baseline booster uptake
* Self-reported race and ethnicity both interesting and important, however:
  * neither sites nor other entity had comprehensive and accurate race and ethnicity data for staff
  * staff survey would only capture a portion of staff members
  * also, didn't know what this would look like with a cluster-level outcome!

---

## Individual-level data structure

Data on `\(n_c\)` staff members in each cluster `\(c = 1, \ldots, K\)`:
* `\(A_{ci}\)`: indicator of intervention assignment (cluster-level)
* `\(Z_{ci} \in \mathbb{R}^q\)`: cluster-level subgroup variables
* `\(W_{ci} \in \mathbb{R}^p\)`: baseline covariates
* `\(Y_{ci}\)`: binary outcome

---

## HTE with individual-level outcomes

Suppose we are interested in HTE by a single binary variable `\(W_{ci}\)`.

Target estimand: the .blue1[difference in the risk difference] based on levels of `\(W_{ci}\)`.

Estimate using linear regression:
`$$E(Y_{ci} \mid A_{ci} = a, Z_{ci} = z, W_{ci} = w) = \beta_0 + \beta_1a + \beta_2z + \beta_3w + \beta_4aw.$$`
--

Under standard assumptions, `\(\beta_4\)` quantifies HTE.

---

## Cluster-level data structure

In many settings, we observe cluster-level data:
* `\(\overline{Y}_c := \frac{1}{n_c}\sum_{i=1}^{n_c} Y_{ci}\)`: cluster-level outcome proportion
* `\(A_c\)`: indicator of intervention assignment
* `\(Z_c \in \mathbb{R}^q\)`: cluster-level subgroup variables
* `\(X_c \in \mathbb{R}^p\)`: (possibly aggregated) baseline covariates

--

Possible options for aggregating an individual-level covariate `\(W_{cj}\)`:
* `\(X_{cj} = V_{cj} - \frac{1}{K}\sum_{c=1}^K V_{cj}\)`, where `\(V_{cj} = \frac{1}{n_c}\sum_{i=1}^{n_c}W_{cji}\)`
* `\(X_{cj} = I\left(V_{cj} &gt; t\right)\)` for threshold `\(t\)`

---

## Aggregated data: complications

Individual-level effects .red[may not be identifiable] based on aggregate data
* Often referred to as .red[ecological bias] .small[[Wakefield (2008)]]
* Exposure-outcome association can be biased: .small[[Greenland &amp; Morgenstern (1989)]]
  * by aggregated confounders
  * by aggregated HTE variables

--

Compositional data cause challenges in .red[interpretation]:
* Arise when aggregating mutually-exclusive binary variables
* Changing the value of one proportion .green[necessarily changes] at least one other

---


## HTE with cluster-level outcomes

Now, outcome `\(\overline{Y}_c\)` is a proportion; interest in HTE by single variable `\(X_c\)`.

Target estimand: .blue1[difference in difference of proportions] based on values of `\(X_{c}\)`.

Estimate using linear regression:
`$$E(\overline{Y}_{c} \mid A_{c} = a, Z_{c} = z, X_{c} = x) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1a + \alpha_2z + \alpha_3x + \alpha_4ax.$$`
--

Under standard assumptions, `\(\alpha_4\)` quantifies HTE.

--

If `\(W\)` represents a single binary variable, then aggregation determines interpretation:
* Using mean-centered proportion: difference in difference .green[for 1-unit increase from the across-cluster mean proportion]
* Using threshold: difference in difference .green[comparing "high" to "low"]

--

If `\(W\)` is compositional, this is further complicated:
* how are the categories transformed to enable model fitting?
* .red[what does a one-unit change imply?]

---


## Simulation setup

Data mimic ENSPIRE trial:
* Sample `\(K \in \{30, 40, 80\}\)` clusters within two regions
* Clusters are urban or suburban/rural
* Randomization constrained to balance on region, urban vs suburban/rural
* Each center has 100 staff members, who each:
  * have record of receiving COVID-19 booster vaccine
  * have self-reported race (recorded as single binary variable)
* Define cluster-level booster rate `\(\overline{Y}_c\)`
* Define two aggregations of self-reported race:
  * center-level proportion
  * indicator of whether proportion &gt; 0.5

--

Fit both .blue1[individual-level] and .blue2[cluster-level] regression models

Tested for HTE by self-reported race, investigated .green[type I error and power]

---

## Results: type I error

&lt;img src="img/presentation_alpha_hte_race.png" width="100%" height="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.small[Scenarios encode presence of true differences in booster rate or HTE: 
* 1, 2, 5: no difference in booster rate by self-reported race, no HTE
* 3, 4, 7: difference in booster rate by self-reported race, no HTE]

---

## Results: type I error

&lt;img src="img/presentation_alpha_hte_race.png" width="100%" height="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.small[Models encode individual- (1) vs cluster-level (2), adjustment and interaction variables:
* 1e, 1f: adjust for self-reported race, allow HTE by self-reported race (1f also by urban)
* 2g, 2i: adjust for center-level race proportion, allow HTE by self-reported race (2i also by urban)
* 2h, 2j: adjust for proportion &gt; 0.5, allow HTE by self-reported race (2j also by urban)]
---

## Results: power

&lt;img src="img/presentation_power_hte_race.png" width="100%" height="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.small[Scenarios encode presence of true differences in booster rate or HTE: 
* 6: difference in booster rate by self-reported race, HTE by self-reported race
* 8: difference in booster rate by urban and self-reported race, HTE by self-reported race
* 9: difference in booster rate by urban and self-reported race, HTE by urban and self-reported race]

* 2h, 2j: adjust for proportion &gt; 0.5, allow HTE by self-reported race (2j also by urban)]

## Closing thoughts

.blue1[High power, controlled type I error] to detect HTE in the individual-level analysis
* where possible, this approach is key for identifying an remedying disparities

.red[Low power] to detect HTE by an aggregated individual-level predictor
* even in simple setting with only two possible categories!
* likely .red[exacerbated] in more realistic settings
* .red[elevated type I error when using proportion] in some settings

However, meaningful estimated differences across groups .blue2[can still be acted upon]

Power calculations should .green[aggregate simulated individual-level data], rather than simulating cluster-level data directly.
