## Heterogeneity of treatment effects: what and why
  
  **Heterogeneity of treatment effects**:
  * differential effect of exposure/intervention across subgroups
* .green[does not necessarily imply a causal or biological interpretation]

--
  
  If HTE is present:
  * .blue1[resources can be prioritized] to maximize benefit and reduce risks .small[[Knol and VanderWeele (2012)]]
* can determine whether intervention .green[remediates] or .red[exacerbates] health disparities .small[[Petkovic et al. (2020)]]

## Case study: ENSPIRE trial
  
  **ENSPIRE**: Engaging Staff to Improve COVID-19 Vaccination Response at Long-term Care Facilities

&zwj;Background:
  * Rates of COVID-19 disease and death higher in long-term care than general population .small[[Chidambaram (2022)]]
* Lag in COVID-19 vaccinations among long-term care workers
* Long-term care (LTC) workers often low-wage, represent diverse social, cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds

--
  
  &zwj;Design:
  * Enrolled 40 LTC centers, encompassing approximately 4000 staff members
* Recruited from 2 US states (Georgia and Washington)
* Recruited from urban (Atlanta or Seattle) and suburban/rural locations

---
  
## Case study: ENSPIRE trial
  
  .blue1[Primary outcomes:]
1. LTC center COVID-19 booster rate (.blue1[cluster-level])
* chosen due to concerns about data capture
2. LTC care staff net promoter score (.blue2[individual-level])

.green[Intervention:] booster promotion materials co-designed with LTC staff

```{r intervention, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.height = "100%", out.width="80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
  "img/enspire_intervention.PNG"
))
```

## Case study: ENSPIRE trial
  
  Co-design: .green[tailoring] messages to specific audiences
* In ENSPIRE, focused on .blue1[language, cultural, and ethnic affinity] groups
* Measured race and ethnicity allowing 57 total options 

--
  
  HTE analysis natural for interventions, particularly co-designed:
  * Planned analyses based on state, urban vs suburban/rural, baseline booster uptake
* Self-reported race and ethnicity both interesting and important, however:
  * neither sites nor other entity had comprehensive and accurate race and ethnicity data for staff
* staff survey would only capture a portion of staff members
* also, didn't know what this would look like with a cluster-level outcome!

---

## Aggregated data: complications

Individual-level effects .red[may not be identifiable] based on aggregate data
* Often referred to as .red[ecological bias] .small[[Wakefield (2008)]]
* Exposure-outcome association can be biased: .small[[Greenland & Morgenstern (1989)]]
  * by aggregated confounders
  * by aggregated HTE variables

--

Compositional data cause challenges in .red[interpretation]:
* Arise when aggregating mutually-exclusive binary variables
* Changing the value of one proportion .green[necessarily changes] at least one other

---

## Simulation setup

Data mimic ENSPIRE trial:
* Sample $K \in \{30, 40, 80\}$ clusters within two regions
* Clusters are urban or suburban/rural
* Randomization constrained to balance on region, urban vs suburban/rural
* Each center has 100 staff members, who each:
  * have record of receiving COVID-19 booster vaccine
  * have self-reported race (recorded as single binary variable)
* Define cluster-level booster rate $\overline{Y}_c$
* Define two aggregations of self-reported race:
  * center-level proportion
  * indicator of whether proportion > 0.5

Fit both .blue1[individual-level] and .blue2[cluster-level] regression models

Tested for HTE by self-reported race, investigated .green[type I error and power]


## Results: power

```{r power-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.height = "100%", out.width="100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/presentation_power_hte_race.png")
```

.small[Scenarios encode presence of true differences in booster rate or HTE: 
* 6: difference in booster rate by self-reported race, HTE by self-reported race
* 8: difference in booster rate by urban and self-reported race, HTE by self-reported race
* 9: difference in booster rate by urban and self-reported race, HTE by urban and self-reported race]

---

## Results: power

```{r power-plot-2, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.height = "100%", out.width="100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/presentation_power_hte_race.png")
```

.small[Models encode individual- (1) vs cluster-level (2), adjustment and interaction variables:
* 1e, 1f: adjust for self-reported race, allow HTE by self-reported race (1f also by urban)
* 2g, 2i: adjust for center-level race proportion, allow HTE by self-reported race (2i also by urban)
* 2h, 2j: adjust for proportion > 0.5, allow HTE by self-reported race (2j also by urban)]

## Closing thoughts

.blue1[High power, controlled type I error] to detect HTE in the individual-level analysis
* where possible, this approach is key for identifying an remedying disparities

.red[Low power] to detect HTE by an aggregated individual-level predictor
* even in simple setting with only two possible categories!
* likely .red[exacerbated] in more realistic settings
* .red[elevated type I error when using proportion] in some settings

However, meaningful estimated differences across groups .blue2[can still be acted upon]

Power calculations should .green[aggregate simulated individual-level data], rather than simulating cluster-level data directly.
